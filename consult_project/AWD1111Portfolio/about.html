    <p id="prgrph1">
        My name is Keegan Young, I was born in Columbia, Missouri in March of 2000. I grew up with a large fascination
        with computers and learning about coding and what coding and programming is about. My interest with these subjects
        really began with my love for video games. I've played video games since I was 5 years old and the more I played
        the more I wanted to learn to code and create my own.
    </p>

    <p id="prgrph2">
        I graduated high school in 2018 and spent a semester at St. Charles Community College. I decided to drop out
        of that school and take a year off school altogether being undecided on what it was I wanted to go to school for. 
        After a year off school, I found Ranken Technical College and found their Application and Web Development program.
    </p>

    <p id="prgrph3">
        I am currently in my third semester of the Application and Web Development program here at Ranken and during these
        three semesters, I have learned many different application and web development subjects including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
        and jQuery. I have also learned C#, Node.js and am knowledgeable in React. My anticipated graduation will be in May of
        2021 and I will recieve my Associates degree in Application and Web Development.
